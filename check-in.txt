Implemented multiple UI and integration improvements to make Weather Smart Wardrobe a usable demo. 
Key changes include adding five meaningful components (`PrimaryNavbar`, `ClothingCard`, `Basket`, `Forecast`, `WeatherSummary`) and updating routing in `src/App.jsx` to include `/forecast` and `/basket`. 
The `Home` page now renders sample `ClothingCard` items. `ClothingCard` supports save/unsave persisted to `localStorage`, and `Basket` reads and displays saved items with a Clear button.
The Forecast page now calls WeatherAPI's `forecast.json` endpoint and maps hourly forecast entries to our card model. 
It supports selecting a date to filter hours and derives simple clothing suggestions from conditions and temperature. 
Added loading/error states, a last-updated timestamp, and a Show Raw toggle to inspect the full API JSON. 
For debugging, there's a Test Fetch button to verify connectivity and display raw response data.
