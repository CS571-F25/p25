Weather Smart Wardrobe is an interactive web application that helps
users plan what to wear based on forecasted weather conditions. By
integrating real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API, the
site provides clothing recommendations tailored to the temperature,
precipitation, and wind conditions of a user-selected day and location.
Users simply input a city and a date within the next week, and the app
automatically fetches the forecast and generates suggested outfits. The
clothing items will be displayed on the website as Cards, and the user
can save certain items and get links to buy them. We are planning on
displaying various clothing items from different brands/retail websites

When the user first goes on the website, the landing page goes to an
input for date and time. Then, when the user submits their
specifications, the forecast for that day is displayed at that location,
along with the different clothing items (ex. Raincoat, sweater, tanktop)
that we recommend. The user can then filter between different types
of clothing items and click on a “save” icon, which then go to a basket
page. In the basket page, different brands for the selected clothing
items are shown, along with links to where the user can buy them from
the retailers’ websites. The saved clothing items will be saved in the
user’s browser, and if the user can then move that item to a “bought”
section on the website.
